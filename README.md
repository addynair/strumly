# Strumly – AI Air Guitar

Strumly is an AI-powered air-guitar application that uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect hand poses and predict guitar chords in real time using a trained **Random Forest model**.  
When you strum in a designated area, the app plays the corresponding guitar audio, allowing you to simulate playing chords without a physical guitar.
